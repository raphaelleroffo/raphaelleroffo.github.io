I"r<p>With an academic background in both urban policy (Sciences Po Paris) and geospatial analysis (UCL), I am passionate about using data analysis towards making a positive impact on society and the environment. I was a 2019 Data Science for Social Good fellow and a Future Stars of Tech 2020 finalist in the Data Science category.</p>

<p>My analytical toolkit includes a mix of GIS and data science tools, and I have strong communication, project management and team coordination skills. I also have experience with public speaking and mentoring, and I am a lecturer at the Sciences Po Urban School.</p>

<p>I have over 7 years experience working on sustainability challenges for a range of public and private organisations in Europe and Asia. Most recently, I joined the French government’s “Entrepreneurs d’Intérêt Général” fellowship as Data Scientist Lead, and was previously a geospatial data scientist for the engineering firm Arup in London. I have also worked as a Sustainable Development Consultant to two major French utility companies, a water and development think tank, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Bangkok.</p>
