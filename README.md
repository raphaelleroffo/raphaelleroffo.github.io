## Welcome to my portfolio!

&nbsp;

My name is RaphaÃ«lle, I'm a geospatial data scientist with a background in sustainable development.

&nbsp;

In this portfolio, you'll find some open source projects I've worked on. They range from traditional GIS to interfacing using Python Dash or Natural Language Processing.

&nbsp;

You will also find my teaching resources, created from scratch to teach GIS and the QGIS software to masters students.
