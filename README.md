# Raphaëlle Roffo - Geospatial data scientist

## Welcome to my portfolio!


My name is Raphaëlle, I'm a geospatial data scientist with a background in sustainable development.

In this portfolio, you'll find some open source projects I've worked on. They range from traditional GIS to interfacing using Python Dash or Natural Language Processing.


You will also find my teaching resources, created from scratch to teach GIS and the QGIS software to masters students.
