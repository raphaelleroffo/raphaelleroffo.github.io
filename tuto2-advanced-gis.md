This course is open sourced under an MIT license. I hope you enjoy learning GIS and exploring the QGIS software! You are also more than welcome to use this material for teaching; however if you do so, please make sure to credit my work :)

&nbsp; 
## Overview

In this course, students will build upon the Introduction to GIS course and explore more advanced techniques for analysing spatial data in QGIS. The course will cover:

- Raster analysis
- Digitization
- Georeferencing
- Bivariate choropleth
- Cartograms
- Weighted overlay / Multi criteria decision analysis

The course aims to provide practical tools and methods, allowing students to use GIS independently in their future research and professional projects.

&nbsp; 
## Pre-requisites

This course requires basic mastering of map production in QGIS, including data gathering, symbology, basic geoprocessing, map layout production and export. This was covered in the [Introduction to GIS](tuto1-intro-to-gis.md) course.

## Format

6 sessions of 2 hours. This course is mostly focused on mastering the open-source software QGIS, and more broadly learning the GIS workflow. Each 2-hour session introduces a new concept and is followed by a tutorial. Students may need to work an additional 30 to 60 minutes between sessions to complete the tutorial.

&nbsp; 
## Coursework

Working in groups of 2 or 3, students will use one or more advanced GIS technique to explore a policy question in one European city. They will produce a policy brief detailing the methodology they adopted and the insights they can draw from this data.
