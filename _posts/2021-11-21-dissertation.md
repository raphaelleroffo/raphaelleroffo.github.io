title: Dissertation â€“ Mapping risks of faecal contamination of shallow groundwater in Dakar, Senegal
---

&nbsp; 

I was incredibly lucky to join the AfriWatSan project as part of my MSc dissertation, and to carry out 2 months of fieldwork in Dakar, Senegal, collecting and analysing close to a hundred groundwater samples. This poster summarizes my research and results.
