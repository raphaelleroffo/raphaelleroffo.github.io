I have been lecturing at the Sciences Po Urban School since September 2020. I teach an Introduction to GIS and an Advanced GIS course to students from the GLM and GETEC masters programmes. My syllabus and entire course material are open sourced under an MIT licence. I hope you enjoy learning GIS and exploring the QGIS software! You are also more than welcome to use this material for teaching; however if you do so, please make sure to credit my work :)
