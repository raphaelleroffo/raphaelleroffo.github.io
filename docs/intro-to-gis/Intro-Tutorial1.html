<p>.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-qgis">Downloading QGIS</h3>
<p>Visit <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html</a></p>
<p>Download the long-term release (most stable) version for your OS. This is a stable and relatively bug-free version as opposed to the latest release in which new features were introduced but you may find some bugs.</p>
<p><strong>MacOS:</strong></p>

<img src="../assets/images/MacOS_download.png" width="700"></p>
<p>You may get an error message as the app was not downloaded through the AppStore. You can override the security settings by following <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT202491">this method</a>.
If you own an old Mac, you may need to download an older version of QGIS. If you are unable to download 3.16, try downloading one of the 2.18 releases from <a href="https://qgis.org/downloads/macOS/">this page</a></p>
<p><strong>Windows users:</strong> download the QGIS Standalone installer, you won&#39;t need the OSGeo4W setup for your usage.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Windows_download.png" width="700"></p>
<p>Once the installer is downloaded and launched, you can follow the steps and use the default options offered in each step. You&#39;re then ready to start mapping!</p>

<h3 id="the-qgis-gui">The QGIS GUI</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s explore the QGIS Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI.png" width="700"></p>
<h4 id="1-opening-a-new-project">1. Opening a new project</h4>
<p>To launch a new project from scratch, you can  click &quot;new empty project&quot; or the white page icon in the toolbar. You may also click <code>Project &gt; New</code> in the top left menu dropdown.</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI2.png" width="700"></p>
<h4 id="2-the-map-canvas">2. The map canvas</h4>
<p>This is where your maps are displayed (in 2D). You can interact with it using the Map Navigation toolbar. You can pan across using the hand, zoom in and out using the magnifier glass, etc. We will get back to this next session when we start loading data into the project.</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI3.png" width="700"></p>
<h4 id="3-the-menu-bar">3. The menu bar</h4>
<p>This is the top layer of your interface, and it contains various dropdown menus:</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI4.png" width="700"></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Project</code> menu allows you to access project files and export them, with tools to open an existing file, create a new one, close a project, save a project to various formats, export the map canvas as an image export with the <code>print layout</code> tools, etc.</li>
<li>The <code>Edit</code> menu allows you to edit a layer&#39;s attributes or geometry, as well as to select features from a layer.</li>
<li>The <code>View</code> menu is a very rich menu. Most importantly, this is where you can toggle on and off the various toolbars and panels that are visible in your interface (more on this in the next section). It also allows you to create new map views next to the main map canvas, to interact with the map canvas (zoom, pan, etc), to get access to the <code>Measure</code> tools and <code>Statistical Summary</code>, to preview your map as seen by a colourblind person or as printed in B&amp;W, to show or hide layers, and more.</li>
<li>The <code>Layer</code> menu allows you to interact with data sources (layers). You will mostly use it to load layers onto your map canvas.</li>
<li>The <code>Settings</code> menu: you should not need to use user profiles or any of the options in this menu.</li>
<li>The <code>Plugins</code> menu: it contains the <code>Manage and Install Plugins…</code> tool, which is basically a library in which you can pick new plugins you can add to QGIS. Those are open source tools that developers are sharing with the community. The <code>Python console</code> allows you to interact with QGIS using Python script. We will use it once this semester, to load basemaps!</li>
<li>The <code>Vector</code> menu contains tools for dealing with vector data: geoprocessing tools, geometry tools, but also analysis, data management and research tools.</li>
<li>The <code>Raster</code> menu contains tools for dealing with raster data. You will mostly use the raster calculator, conversion tools and analysis tools.</li>
<li>The <code>Processing</code> menu contains shortcuts to the Processing toolbox, your processing history and other functions you won&#39;t need.</li>
<li>The <code>Help</code> menu links to the official QGIS documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Other menus may be present if you have downloaded or enabled additional plugins (Mesh, Web, Database), but you won&#39;t need them for this course.</p>
<h4 id="4-the-toolbars">4. The toolbars</h4>
<p>Toolbars are located below the menu bar. </p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI5.png" width="700"></p>
<p>They can be moved by clicking the grey dots to the left, and you can rearrange them in the order you find best for your workflows. You can also unpin any toolbar out of the toolbar area, by clicking the grey dots and dragging it out of the top area; I would however advise against this as you might lose track of where your toolbars went.</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI5bis.png" width="700"></p>
<p>Very importantly, you can toggle each of the toolbar on and off by going into your menu <code>View</code> &gt; <code>Toolbars</code> and ticking or unticking the toolbars you want to show or hide.</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI6.png" width="700"></p>
<h4 id="5-the-panels">5. The panels</h4>
<p>The panels are located to the sides of the map canvas (left and right). </p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI7.png" width="700"></p>
<p>Similarly to the toolbars, you can toggle each of the panels on and off by going into your menu <code>View</code> &gt; <code>Panels</code> and ticking or unticking the toolbars you want to show or hide.</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI7bis.png" width="700"></p>
<p>They can be rearranged by dragging the top of a panel and moving it. This may lead to the panel being unpinned from the side and just floating on top of your interface. To pin back to either side, it depends on which version of QGIS you&#39;re working with and which OS. You can try dragging it back into its place until it becomes blue and snaps back, or double clicking the title of that panel.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you snap a panel back where a panel already exists, it will create two tabs. You can click a tab and drag it to reposition it where you want.</p>
<p>There are three very important panels you need to know about:</p>
<p><u>Browser</u>: This panel allows you to navigate in your computer&#39;s file system, and in particular to load data onto your map canvas by simply dragging &amp; dropping it. More info on the <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/opening_data.html#browser-panel">official documentation</a></p>
<p><img src="../img/Browser.png" width="200"></p>
<p><u>Layers</u>: This panel displays a list of the layers that are loaded onto your map canvas. From there, you can show to hide any given layer, you can edit the order in which they are layered, and you can access a layer&#39;s properties window.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Layers.png" width="200"></p>
<p><u>Processing toolbox</u>: The processing toolbox contains all of QGIS algorithms, and a search bar for you to access them.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Processing.png" width="200"></p>
<h4 id="6-the-status-bar">6. The status bar</h4>
<p>The status bar contains general information about the map view: the zoom level, the coordinates of where you mouse is, the EPSG of the coordinate reference system your map canvas is set to.</p>
<p><img src="../img/GUI8.png" width="700"></p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>The QGIS documentation is available at this address: <a href="https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html">https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html</a></p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This course is taught in English but some of you will have a version of QGIS installed that&#39;s in a different language. If you are trying to understand how a function translates into that language, at any time when navigating the documentation you can change the language of the page directly in the url (by replacing <code>/en/</code> by <code>/fr/</code> for French, or <code>/es/</code> for Spanish, <code>/zh-Hans/</code> for Mandarin Chinese etc.): For instance to go from English: <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html">https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html</a> to French: <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/fr/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html">https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/fr/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Similarly, you might have a version installed that is not 3.16 ; you can also edit the version directly in the URL to match the release you&#39;re using, by changing <code>/3.16/</code> . For instance from QGIS version 3.16 <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html">https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html</a> to QGIS version 2.18 <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html">https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html</a> </p>
